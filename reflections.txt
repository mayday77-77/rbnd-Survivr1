How does your gem take advantage of Rubyâ€™s metaprogramming capabilities?
Ans: From the lessons taught, I make use of the class_eval to create the methods on the fly.

How long did you spend working on this project?
Ans: Just a few days as it seems like a short assignment, but I am still  re-reading the concepts of metaprogramming
and looking at the external links provided by the lessons.
Also took some time to do up the README.md properly.

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Ans: Able to use metaprogramming concept into this project. Though small and simple, but a good learning experience.

Where do you still have room to grow?
Ans: Should try other dynamc methods like define_method and method_missing to see how they can work in this project.
